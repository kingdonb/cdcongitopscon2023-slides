# Lightning Talk


Gotta go pretty fast

* Try not to talk so fast
* Don't want to lose everyone
* We're going to talk about Wasm

# Intro

* Hi
  I'm Kingdon Barrett
* Find me on YouTube or Mastodon
* youtube.com/@yebyen
* hachyderm.io/@yebyen

# Job

* Weaveworks: Dev Experience
* OSS Engineer since 2021
* Second S is for ~~Smooth Operator~~ (no, it's Support!)
* I work on Flux (Maintainer)

# Flux

* Flux Bug Scrub - weekly(ish) for over a year
* You need an Open Source Support Engineer
* (Someone that uses your OSS deeply)
* Find Flux at GitOpsCon/OSS Summit

# Flux Talks

# Intro (me)

* On YouTube - I'm new here
* Let's Study: Arabic
* Cloud Jockey: %radio ‚ö°Ô∏èüå©Ô∏èüåÄüå©Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
* Live Coding: Ruby + Kubernetes

# Wasm and Ruby

* *What is this for*
* What is "untrusted code"
* Why do we want to run it

# Ruby

* Can Wasm? run it
* Yes
* Why would we do that?
  * This is a serious question
  * Do you know why Wasm?

# Why Wasm

* Secure Foundation
* "Bytecode Alliance"
* Portable artifacts
  * with language independence

# Compiled Languages

* Rust
* Go
* JavaScript, TypeScript
* C#
* ...

# Web Assembly in Ruby

* Ruby is an interpreted language
* wasmer-ruby
* wasmtime-rb
* Run Web Assemblies in Ruby
* What is a Web Assembly?

# Bytecode Runtime Format

* Can you run Ruby in Web Assembly?
* Yes, but first...
* Web Assembly is a binary
  * You can run it
* Web Assembly is also a library
  * Include it in other programs

# Web Assembly

* Call functions from it
* Ship memory around
* Export functions to it
* Use a compiler
* Or...
* System Interface (WASI)

# Features: Format

* What is a system interface?
* Stdio
* There is no network
* How do you run a server?
  * WAGI (it's like CGI!)

# Omitted Features

* Wasm does not have a string type
* Numbers and well-defined data structures
* You can allocate memory and make a pointer
* Keep the length around

# Ruby and pointers

* I don't want to do pointer math at all
* Could not figure out how to do:
  * Wasm as library
* I spent some time on this
* Reverted to WASI
* We can parse the output üëç

# What is Spin?

* Fermyon "Serverless" framework
* Test locally
* Run on Fermyon Cloud
* (Run on Hippo Factory)
  * This is OSS Summit!

# What is Spin?

* Fermyon "Serverless" framework
* Test locally
* Run on Fermyon Cloud
* (Run on Hippo Factory)
  * ~~This is OSS Summit!~~

# Why are we here?

* Hope to gain:
* Testability
* Reusability
* Type safety between languages

# How about we dive in?

* I built some things in Wasm
* Here's what not to do
* I needed to break misconceptions
* How are we going to use this?

# I built some things

* EKS cluster: [kingdonb/eks-cluster][]
  * with Flux bootstrap (eksctl+flux 2.0.0-rc.2)
*
